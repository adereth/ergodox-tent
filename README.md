# ergodox-tent

A tent for the [Ergodox acrylic case designed by Litster](http://deskthority.net/wiki/ErgoDox).  The design was implemented using clj-scad.

## Usage

If you're just interested in printing your own, just download [resources/tent.stl](resources/tent.stl) and feed it into your favorite software for 3D printing.

If you'd like to contribute, I'd prefer you make changes to the original Clojure source.  I've also included the [generated SCAD](resources/tent.scad) if you want to experiment and don't have a Clojure environment set up.
